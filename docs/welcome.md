Are you ready to learn? The goal of Rhythm is to teach you data structures and
algorithms. We'll implement commonly used data structures and algorithms in
[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/). These implementations will be readable,
practical, and efficient. In fact, they will be released as a library that can
be used in your own projects!

Happy learning!

_(To use the released code, head on over to the [API docs](usage).)_
