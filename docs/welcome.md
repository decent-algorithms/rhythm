> ðŸš§ The site is currently under construction ðŸš§

Let's get into a learning rhythm! This site is structured to teach you about
data structures and algorithms. I believe one of the best ways to do that is
to implement most commonly used data structures and algorithms (and a
bunch extra just for fun!). These implementations should be readable,
practical, and fast. There will also be some guides on related topics as we go
along.

All of the code here will be documented and released to be used in your
projects. If you are just looking to consume these data structures, head on
over to the [API docs](usage).

Happy learning!
